Hi, I’m Souradeep — a Data Analyst in the making and a Canva Pro Designer with over 5 years of creative experience. I’ve spent 9+ years as a Core PHP developer, building functional web solutions with MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Now, I combine my analytical mindset with my design background to tell stories through both data and visuals.

🔹 Data Tools: Python, Excel, Power BI, SQL
🔹 Design Tools: Canva Pro, Photoshop (basic), Figma (basic)
🔹 Web Skills: PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

I’m currently working on building my portfolio with projects that showcase real-world insights and design creativity.

✉️ Open to collaboration, freelance work, and creative data projects.
